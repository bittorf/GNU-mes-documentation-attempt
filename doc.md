### how to bootstrap a compiler with toolchain

The goal of this project is to write a program, which can
compile a better program, which can compile a compiler,
which can than compile a better compiler and so on...

Once we have a compiler, we can start compiling all the
helpers, so that our workbench is fully populated till
we have a full toolchain.

All these steps should be understandable for the majority
of programmers, otherwise the steps must be rewritten or
better documentated:

The goal is not to have as small programs as possible, but
to have a sourcecode which is clearly readable.
